# clj_blekko

Clojure interface to the blekko API. AFAIK, the API is no longer
available for free use but I obtained my API access a while back.

## Usage

With leiningen:

```
[clj_blekko "0.1.0"]
```

With maven:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>clj_blekko</groupId>
  <artifactId>clj_blekko</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

You can just do this:

```
user> (use 'clj-blekko.core :reload)

user> (clojure.pprint/pprint (:RESULT (run-query "shriphani" api-key :json true :page 2)))
